## Video Walk Through:

## Overview:

Brand kits are important for a brand because they include all elements of their visual brand identity and help build consistency surrounding their brand. Brandy is a website that generates a brand kit based on the information that the user inputs about their brand. The website also includes a cat mascot named Brandy that cheers the user on as they build their brand kit.
